The move represents a break with the Spanish government’s non-committal attitude of previous days. Spain's opposition Socialist Party (PSOE) has criticized the executive’s silence regarding controversial orders signed by US President Donald Trump, including the construction of a border wall with Mexico and a travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim countries.

On Wednesday, Rajoy and Peña Nieto discussed the difficult moment for US-Mexico relations, and the Spanish leader asked his counterpart about his short-term plans, according to sources at La Moncloa, the Spanish seat of government.

Both men agreed that it is “essential and indispensable” to restore good bilateral relations between the neighboring countries.
